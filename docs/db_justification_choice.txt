In our case, there's a loan scenario (borrow, return books).
We need to handle this case properly.
Thus, it's better to use DB that ACID compliance.
That's why we're going to choose SQL rather than NoSQL.
There are also many options for relational databases. Top 3, I would say PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle
Oracle is well-known for enterprise but it has big cost. So, I will choose PostgreSQL or MySQL since they are open source n free to use
Then the battle begins
For me, personally, PostgreSQL is the better choice since:
1. PostgreSQL use MVCC rather than locking mechanism for transaction isolation handling. This will result in better concurrent read/write performance
2. PostgreSQL has JSONB type while MySQL has JSON. JSONB has better performance since it is in binary format and also has more operators
3. PostgreSQL has built-in full text search. This might allow us to implement search book by title API.
    This is really helpful for small-medium application since we dont really need to develop n deploy other service like elasticsearch
Conclusion, PostgreSQL is the most suitable DB for library management system service with ACID compliance, better concurrent handling, and also its potential to handle future cases like search text
